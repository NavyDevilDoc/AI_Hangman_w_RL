# AI_Hangman_w_RL
A very good friend of mine was telling me about a problem he was given and while I have been working 
on everything sensors lately (with more to come), I could not help but tackle this problem also. In this 
repository, I tried my hand at building a reinforcement learning-enabled model to play Hangman. The goal 
is a win percentage greater than 50%.


This is my first foray into the world of reinforcement learning (RL) and frankly, I'm sure it
will be evident. There are multiple ways to solve this problem, I'd have to imagine, but the problem statement
seemed to lend itself well towards RL. Don't hesitate to hit me with your recommendations for alternative
solution architectures!

My initial solution design was to employ Q-Learning and once I got through the initial "dude...what are you doing?"
moments, I got to a point where I saw actual training happening. At some point, I dug into Deep-Q Networks but
ultimately went away from that because I wasn't quite following what was going on, and if I can't explain it to
myself, I can't explain it to anyone else.
